# Taxonomy-of-RCs---Replication-Package---Madampe-et-al.
This is the replication package of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering paper on Taxonomy of Requirements Changes in Agile Contexts | Kashumi Madampe; Rashina Hoda; John Grundy

The study followed a mixed-methods approach (a series of interviews, a focused literature review, and a practitioner survey).

This repository contains,
1. Pre-interview questionnaire;
2. Interview guide;
3. Survey questionnaire; and
4. Survey data: all raw, analysed quantitative;
relavant to this study.

Since some of the qualitative data we collected through the interviews are:
1. Out of scope of this study; and
2. We use them in other studies;
We do not provide the interview transcripts here.

We invite researchers to replicate this study. We appreciate if you could let us know the results via email (See the paper for contact information).

Good Luck!
