# Taxonomy-of-RCs---Replication-Package---Madampe-et-al.
This is the replication package of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering paper on Taxonomy of Requirements Changes in Agile Contexts | Kashumi Madampe; Rashina Hoda; John Grundy

This repository contains,
1. Pre-interview questionnaire;
2. Interview guide;
3. Survey questionnaire; and
4. Survey data: all raw, analysed quantitative;
relavant to this study.

Since some of the qualitative data are:
1. Out of scope of this study;
2. Difficult to separate; and
3. We use them in our other studies;
We do not provide them here.

We invite researchers to replicate this study. We appreciate if you could let us know the results via email (See the paper for contact information).

Good Luck!
